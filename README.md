# This repository is a mess.

These are some AutoHotKey scripts I wrote or scavenged. They probably will be not usefull for you, as they are mediocre quality and very specific to my workflow and keyboard. 

## Installation 'n' setup:
I don't know why this repo has an Installation guide. Don't use it!

* You need to install AutoHotKey (https://autohotkey.com)
* Drop your AutoHotKey scripts to this project's startup folder.
* Add **shortcut to startup.bat** to your system's startup folder (*win+R* and type: *shell:startup* and press *Enter*).
